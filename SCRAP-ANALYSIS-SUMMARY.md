### üéØ Key Insights

1. **Balanced Performance**: The 51.4% planned vs 48.6% unplanned split is actually quite good for a tool & die manufacturer. Industry average for unplanned scrap often exceeds 60%.

2. **Focus Areas**:
   - **Mechanical/Robotic Assembly** (89.8% unplanned) needs immediate attention
   - **Welders** (85.8% unplanned) also critical
   - **Pioneer** area has highest dollar impact at $478K

3. **Positive Trends**:
   - March-July showed improvement (unplanned dropping to 43-45%)
   - August spike may be due to partial month data

4. **Realistic Savings Target**:
   - 50% reduction in unplanned scrap = $284K annual savings
   - More realistic 25% reduction = $142K annual savings
   - Focus on top 5 unplanned reasons first

### üîß Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate** (Week 1-2):
   - Investigate fracture issues (Code 13) - $94K opportunity
   - Review die maintenance procedures
   - Check press alignment and tonnage settings

2. **Short-term** (Month 1):
   - Implement daily scrap review meetings
   - Create visual scrap tracking boards
   - Train operators on slug mark prevention (Code 23)

3. **Medium-term** (Quarter 1):
   - Upgrade tooling in Mechanical/Robotic Assembly
   - Implement predictive maintenance program
   - Create operator certification program

4. **Long-term** (Year 1):
   - Install vision systems for quality detection
   - Implement statistical process control (SPC)
   - Target 25% reduction in unplanned scrap
